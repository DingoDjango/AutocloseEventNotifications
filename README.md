![Autoclose Event Notifications](http://i.imgur.com/ocSigpw.png)

Ever get tired of right-clicking those notifications like "New Lovers" or "Eclipse"?

This mod automatically closes old notifications (default: after 12 in-game hours).

By default, only good (blue) and non-urgent (yellow) notifications are closed.

The mod includes an options menu (**Options > Mod Settings**).
